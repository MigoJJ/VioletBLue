  Findings in Thyroid Disease
------------------------------
Thyroid Enlargement
	Diffuse Enlargement: 																	
	Single node: 
		Assess for risk factors: 
			radiation exposure, 
			hardness, 
			rapid growth, 
			fixation to surrounding tissue, 
			cervical LAD, 
			male, 
			others.
	Multinodular Goiter 
		(iodine deficiency)

Soft 		

Firm 

Tender 

Systolic or continuous Bruit

Thyroid problems include:
Goiter - enlargement of the thyroid gland
Hyperthyroidism - when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs
Hypothyroidism - when your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormones
Thyroid cancer
Thyroid nodules - lumps in the thyroid gland
Thyroiditis - swelling of the thyroid

Systemic examination
Hands
Inspect
Palmar erythema (hyperthyroid)
Thyroid acropachy
Clubbing and digit swelling in Graves’ disease
Palpate
Temperature
Hot and clammy if hyperthyroid
Cold if hypothyroid
Pulse
Tachycardia or atrial fibrillation (hyperthyroid)
Tremor
Best seen by resting a piece of paper on patient’s outstretched hands
Fine tremor (hyperthyroid)
Face
Hypothyroid:
Coarse facies
Thin hair.
Loss of the lateral third of the eyebrows (Hertoghe’s sign) is highly variable
Eyes
Inspection
Chemosis (conjunctival oedema)
Exopthalmos (Graves’ Disease)
Warn the patient you will go behind them. From behind, look down to see if the patient’s eyes protrude
Test eye movements
Complex ophthalmoplegia (diplopia not consistent with one cranial nerve palsy)
Lid retraction
Upper lid is retracted upwards and lower lid is retracted downwards
Lid lag
Sclera can be seen between iris and upper eyelid when patient looks down due to delay in eyelid movement
Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD – hyperthyroid)
 Trunk
Proximal myopathy (hyper/hypothyroid)
Ask patient to cross arms and stand up from chair
 Legs
Pretibial myxoedema (Graves’ Disease)
 Reflexes
Brisk (hyperthyroid)
Slow-relaxing (hypothyroid)
