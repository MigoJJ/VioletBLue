Systolic or continuous Bruit (y/n)

1) Thyroid acropatchy 
2) Onycholysis of nails 
3) Palmar erythema & warm, sweaty hands 
4) Resting tremor 
-------------------------------
1) Exophthalmos 
				Class 0				
				No signs or symptoms
				Class 1   
				Only signs (limited to upper lid retraction and stare, with or without lid lag)
				Class 2
				Soft tissue involvement (oedema of conjunctivae and lids, conjunctival injection, etc.)
				Class 3
				Proptosis
				Class 4
				Extraocular muscle involvement (usually with diplopia)
				Class 5
				Corneal involvement (primarily due to lagophthalmos)
				Class 6
				Sight loss (due to optic nerve involvement)

2) double or blurred vision  
3) Nystagmus  
4) Lid lag

1. shins for pretibial myxoedema 

Pretibial myxedema (PTM) or, more appropriately, thyroid dermopathy, is a term used to describe localized lesions of the skin resulting from the deposition of hyaluronic acid

2. ankles for oedema 
3. stand up w/out using hands If unable, proximal myopathy 
4. DTR deep tendon reflex
		In general, the grades are as follows: 
		1+ = present but depressed 
		2+ = normal / average 
		3+ = increased 
		4+ = clonus
		
		By convention the deep tendon reflexes are graded as follows:

		0 = no response; always abnormal
		1+ = a slight but definitely present response; may or may not be normal
		2+ = a brisk response; normal
		3+ = a very brisk response; may or may not be normal
		4+ = a tap elicits a repeating reflex (clonus); always abnormal

Assess whether the thyroid may be overactive or underactive












Firm in Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis, malignancy, & benign and malignant nodules.

Tender in thyroiditis.

Systolic or continuous bruit may be heard over lateral lobes in hyperthyroidism.

Anxiety

Irritability or moodiness

Nervousness, hyperactivity

Sweating or sensitivity to high temperatures

Hand trembling (shaking)

Hair loss

Missed or light menstrual periods

The following are other symptoms that may indicate too little T3 and T4 in your body (hypothyroidism):
